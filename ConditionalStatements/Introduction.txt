Conditional Statements :
    In any programming language conditional statements are like "instructions"
    that tells the computer to do different things based on certain conditions.

Conditional statements are of three types:
    1.if condition
    2.if-else condition
    3.switch statement 

Let's take an real life example,
    you have decided to go to a movie but outside is raining, Now imagine what to wear 
    in general it is simple to answer, but think how to ans it in coding 
    ok now learn how to answer it in the coding aspect

1.if statement: 
    it is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

    // if condition
      if(weather = raining) {
        System.out.println("Take umbrella");
      }

2.if-else statement:
    it is used to execute a block of code if the specified condition is true, 
    and another block of code if the condition is false.

    // if-else condition
     if(weather = sunny) {
        system.out.println("wear glasses");
     } else {
        system.out.println("take umbrella");
     }

     in the above code, observe carefully our conditon is weather is raining but the if block condition is false, hence it will print else block code.

3.switch statement:
    it is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

    // switch condition
    switch(2) {
        case 1: System.out.print("Wear sunglasses"); break;
        case 2: system.out.print("take umbrella"); break;
        case 3: system.out.print("go normally"); break;
    }

    in the above code, the switch condition is aiming for certain condition, the condition is satisfied in the case 2 statement, it will print the output.
